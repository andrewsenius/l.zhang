## Biography [[UCL IRIS Profile](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=LZHAF35)]

I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the **[Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/research/centres/queen-square-multiple-sclerosis-centre)**, Institute of Neurology, and **[Centre for Medical Image Computing (POND)](http://pond.cs.ucl.ac.uk/team/)**, Department of Computer Science, University College London, working with **[Prof. Olga Ciccarelli](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=OCICC52)**, **[Prof. Daniel Alexander](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.alexander/)** and **[Prof. Parashkev Nachev](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=PNACH75)**. Before my postdoc research, I was a PhD student in the Center of **[Computational Imaging and Simulation Technologies in Biomedicine (CISTIB)](http://www.cistib.org/)**, from University of Sheffield. I work under the supervision of **[Prof. Dr. Alejandro F Frangi](http://www.cistib.org/afrangi/)** (IEEE Fellow) and **[Dr. Marco Pereanez](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=en&user=LsKzGqkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)**, I also have a close link with **[Prof. Dr. Steffen Peterson](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/whri/people/academic-staff/items/petersensteffen.html)** (Queen Mary University of London), **[Prof. Dr. Stefan K. Piechnik](https://www.rdm.ox.ac.uk/people/stefan-piechnik)** and **[Prof. Dr. Stefan Neubauer](https://www.rdm.ox.ac.uk/people/stefan-neubauer)** (University of Oxford).   

My research interests lie in Medical Image Computing and Machine Learning. My PhD research topic is Population Cardiac MRI Quality Assessment and Deep Learning using **[UK Biobank](http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/)** Dataset.  

My current research aims to create a prototype software (or a decision-support tool) that predicts whether an individual patient with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) will respond to a medication by using machine learning techniques. This is a crucial step towards “personalized medicine”, which means to be able to prescribe the right treatment for the right patient.
