## Biography [[About Le](https://about.me/l.zhang)]

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Centre of **[Computational Imaging and Simulation Technologies in Biomedicine (CISTIB)](http://www.cistib.org/)**, from University of Sheffield. I work under the supervision of **[Prof. Dr. Alejandro F Frangi](http://www.cistib.org/afrangi/)** (IEEE Fellow) and **[Dr. Marco Pereanez](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=en&user=LsKzGqkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)**, I also have a close link with **[Prof. Dr. Steffen Peterson](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/whri/people/academic-staff/items/petersensteffen.html)** (Queen Mary University of London), **[Prof. Dr. Stefan K. Piechnik](https://www.rdm.ox.ac.uk/people/stefan-piechnik)** and **[Prof. Dr. Stefan Neubauer](https://www.rdm.ox.ac.uk/people/stefan-neubauer)** (University of Oxford). I received my MSc degree from Wuhan University of Technology in 2015, and BSc degree from South-Central University for Nationalities in 2012.  

My research interests lie in Medical Image Computing and Machine Learning. My current research topic is Population Cardiac MRI Quality Assessment and Deep Learning using UK Biobank Dataset.
