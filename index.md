## About Le

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Centre of Computational Imaging and Simulation Technologies in Biomedicine (**CISTIB**), from University of Sheffield. I work under the supervision of **Prof. Dr. Alejandro F Frangi** (IEEE Fellow), I also have a close link with Dr. Marco Pereanez, Prof. Dr. Steffen Peterson (Queen Mary University of London), Prof. Dr. Stefan K. Piechnik and Prof. Dr. Stefan Neubauer (University of Oxford). I received my MSc degree from Wuhan University of Technology in 2015, and BSc degree from South-Central University for Nationalities in 2012.	

My research interests lie in Medical Image Computing and Machine Learning. My current research topic is Population Cardiac MRI Quality Assessment and Deep Learning.

### Project

My research involved a comprehensive exploration of the development of robust and interpretable deep learning and machine learning models for large-scale population imaging computation, including cardiac MRI quality assessment. In my current research, I am seeking to improve the transfer ability, generalization, and robustness of deep adversarial models, such as conditional generative adversarial net (cGAN). Another focus is the interpretation of deep adversarial models through human-understandable feedback, including data synthesis and visualisation, and attribute-based reasoning. My ongoing programme of research aims to synthesize novel data that is difficult to acquire for missing data of cardiac MRI, and realise expert-level recognition performance through knowledge-guided inference mechanisms.
