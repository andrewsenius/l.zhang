## Biography [[About Le](https://about.me/l.zhang)]

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Centre of **Computational Imaging and Simulation Technologies in Biomedicine (CISTIB)**, from University of Sheffield. I work under the supervision of **Prof. Dr. Alejandro F Frangi** (IEEE Fellow) and **Dr. Marco Pereanez**, I also have a close link with **Prof. Dr. Steffen Peterson** (Queen Mary University of London), **Prof. Dr. Stefan K. Piechnik** and **Prof. Dr. Stefan Neubauer** (University of Oxford). I received my MSc degree from Wuhan University of Technology in 2015, and BSc degree from South-Central University for Nationalities in 2012.        My research interests lie in Medical Image Computing and Machine Learning. My current research topic is Population Cardiac MRI Quality Assessment and Deep Learning.
