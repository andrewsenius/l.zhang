### Project

My research involved a comprehensive exploration of the development of robust and interpretable deep learning and machine learning models for large-scale population imaging computation, including cardiac MRI quality assessment. In my current research, I am seeking to improve the transfer ability, generalization, and robustness of deep adversarial models, such as conditional generative adversarial net (cGAN). Another focus is the interpretation of deep adversarial models through human-understandable feedback, including data synthesis and visualisation, and attribute-based reasoning. My ongoing programme of research aims to synthesize novel data that is difficult to acquire for missing data of cardiac MRI, and realise expert-level recognition performance through knowledge-guided inference mechanisms.
